Page 1 of 5 National Transportation Safety Board Aviation Accident Final Report Location: White Plains, AL Accident Number: NYC08CA058 Date & Time: 12/08/2007, 1430 CST  Registration: N43682 Aircraft: Fisher Aero Celebrity Aircraft Damage: Substantial Defining Event: Injuries: 1 None Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal Analysis    During cruise flight, the pilot of an amateur built airplane noticed that the airplane began to  vibrate.  He applied carburetor heat, and then checked the magnetos to see if they were  functioning properly, but the vibration persisted.  Moments later, the vibration became worse,  and the wooden propeller came apart.  The pilot shut down the engine and made a forced  landing in a field.  After touchdown, the landing gear collapsed, and the airplane received  substantial damage. The pilot had recently purchased the airplane, and had flown it for  approximately 55 minutes prior to the accident.  According to the pilot, the airplane's original  logbooks had been misplaced, and new ones were begun prior to the sale.  The airplane's total  time in service was estimated to be 190 hours.  No entries regarding propeller inspections or  propeller maintenance were noted in the new logbooks. Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: A propeller failure during cruise flight.

Page 5 of 5 NYC08CA058 The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated  by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine  the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate  the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and  decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and  statistical reviews.  The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence  or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a  matter mentioned in the report. A factual report that may be admissible under 49 U.S.C. § 1154(b) is available here.
