Page 1 of 4 National Transportation Safety Board Aviation Accident Final Report Location: Alton, NH Accident Number: NYC08CA068 Date & Time: 12/22/2007, 1230 EST  Registration: N3070A Aircraft: Cessna 170B Aircraft Damage: Substantial Defining Event: Injuries: 4 None Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal Analysis    The pilot stated that he took three friends on a short cross-country pleasure flight. The airplane  was entering a downwind leg at the destination airport, when the pilot decided to make a low  pass over an adjacent lake, near a friend's property.  The pilot said that his depth perception  was negatively affected due to the flat light and snow on the ground.  While maneuvering over  the lake, the right main landing gear contacted the snowy frozen surface, which resulted in the  right wing impacting the surface.  The airplane came to rest upright on the frozen lake, and  sustained substantial damage to the right wing and firewall.  The reported weather at an  airport about 10 miles north of the accident site, about the time of the accident, included calm  winds and an overcast ceiling at 2,200 feet. Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain clearance above a frozen lake while maneuvering.  Factors  contributing to the accident were the pilot's attempt of the low altitude maneuver, and  unfavorable lighting conditions.

Page 4 of 4 NYC08CA068 The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated  by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine  the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate  the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and  decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and  statistical reviews.  The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence  or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a  matter mentioned in the report. A factual report that may be admissible under 49 U.S.C. § 1154(b) is available here.
