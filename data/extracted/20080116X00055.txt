Page 1 of 4 National Transportation Safety Board Aviation Accident Final Report Location: Soledad, CA Accident Number: LAX08CA034 Date & Time: 12/06/2007, 1030 PST  Registration: N6024M Aircraft: Air Tractor AT-401 Aircraft Damage: Destroyed Defining Event: Injuries: 1 Serious Flight Conducted Under: Part 137: Agricultural Analysis    The pilot was seeding an area located adjacent to mountainous terrain.  Prior to making the  first pass, he had flown a reconnaissance flight to inspect the area.  After completion of the first  pass as he was maneuvering in a turn back towards the field, he was checking the seeding  pattern and making adjustments to the GPS system inside the cockpit.  When he checked the  gauges again, he realized that the airplane had lost airspeed and rolled out to a wings level  configuration to regain the lost airspeed.  The airplane was headed towards rising terrain.  He  jettisoned the remaining seed and made a controlled collision with terrain in a ravine.  The  airplane was destroyed in a post impact fire.  He reported that he had preoccupied himself with  less important flight duties at a critical time during the flight.  The pilot reported no  mechanical problems that would have precluded normal operation. Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate clearance from mountainous terrain while  maneuvering during an aerial application mission.  Contributing to the accident was the pilot's  diverted attention inside the cockpit. Findings Occurrence #1: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING - AERIAL APPLICATION Findings 1. TERRAIN CONDITION - MOUNTAINOUS/HILLY 2. (C) IN-FLIGHT PLANNING/DECISION - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND 3. (F) DIVERTED ATTENTION - PILOT IN COMMAND 4. (C) CLEARANCE - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND

Page 4 of 4 LAX08CA034 The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated  by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine  the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate  the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and  decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and  statistical reviews.  The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence  or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a  matter mentioned in the report. A factual report that may be admissible under 49 U.S.C. § 1154(b) is available here.
