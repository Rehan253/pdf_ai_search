He then fully extended the  wing flaps, but the power setting remained above the "trigger point" for the landing gear  warning horn.  The airplane touched down with the landing gear retracted and was  substantially damaged.

Page 4 of 4 NYC08CA073 The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated  by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine  the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate  the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and  decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and  statistical reviews.  The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence  or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a  matter mentioned in the report. A factual report that may be admissible under 49 U.S.C. § 1154(b) is available here.
