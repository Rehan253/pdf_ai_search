Page 1 of 5 National Transportation Safety Board Aviation Accident Final Report Location: Houston, TX Accident Number: DFW08CA051 Date & Time: 12/28/2007, 0830 CST  Registration: N1458U Aircraft: Cessna 172 Aircraft Damage: Substantial Defining Event: Injuries: 1 None Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal Analysis    The private pilot was flying multiple visual patterns on a 40-foot wide asphalt runway.  Winds  were reported by the pilot as variable and gusting.  The pilot stated that during the third touch- and-go, the wind shifted to a crosswind with a tailwind component. While reconfiguring for  takeoff, the pilot perceived a faster than normal groundspeed.  A gust of wind contacted the  airplane's tail pushing the nose to the left.  The pilot attempted to correct back to centerline but  was hesitant to input an aggressive correction due to the faster than normal groundspeed.  The  left main gear ran off the runway onto the grass and the airplane departed the left side of the  runway.  The nose gear sank into mud and was separated.  The nose gear strut dug into the  muddy terrain and the airplane nosed over coming to rest in the inverted position.  On a NTSB  Form 6120.1, the pilot reported that the accident could have been prevented with a more  aggressive rudder input. Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control.  A contributing factor was prevailing crosswind.

Page 5 of 5 DFW08CA051 The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated  by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine  the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate  the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and  decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and  statistical reviews.  The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence  or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a  matter mentioned in the report. A factual report that may be admissible under 49 U.S.C. § 1154(b) is available here.
