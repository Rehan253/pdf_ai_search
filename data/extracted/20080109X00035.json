The airplane began to veer left and right, so  the pilot applied power and climbed to an altitude of 30 to 50 feet.  The airplane then rolled  and turned left before it overflew the left edge of the runway and parallel taxiway, while  continuing to turn past a heading perpendicular to the runway centerline.  The airplane  continued the left turn, in an approximate 30-degree bank, and began to descend toward a low  wetland adjacent to the runway.  The aircraft struck the ground left wingtip first, and the left  wing and left main gear separated from the airframe.  The airplane then cartwheeled  counterclockwise coming to rest upright on the right main landing gear and forward fuselage.   This was the pilot's second incident in an RV-8.  Approximately one year prior to the accident,  in a different RV-8, the pilot also experienced a loss of control while practicing landings,  during which the airplane veered off the left side of the runway and struck a taxiway light. Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing."

The NTSB makes public its actions and  decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and  statistical reviews.  The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence  or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a  matter mentioned in the report. A factual report that may be admissible under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(b) is available here."
