Page 1 of 4 National Transportation Safety Board Aviation Accident Final Report Location: Murfreesboro, TN Accident Number: NYC08CA040 Date & Time: 11/16/2007, 0850 CST  Registration: N4396T Aircraft: Piper PA-28-140 Aircraft Damage: Substantial Defining Event: Injuries: 2 None Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional Analysis    During an instructional flight the student pilot slipped the Piper PA-28-140 in order to lose  altitude while on final approach for landing.  After reaching a "reasonable approach altitude"  the student then realigned the airplane and continued the final approach.  During the flare, the  student "flared way too much," and the airplane ballooned.  The instructor then "grabbed" the  controls and added full power in an attempt to recover.  According to the instructor, the  airplane was so close to the ground at this point that it did not have time to climb out.  The  instructor then "chose" to touchdown in the grass to the left of the runway, substantially  damaging the airplane. Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The flight instructor's inadequate remedial action and failure to maintain runway alignment. Findings Occurrence #1: ON GROUND/WATER ENCOUNTER WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: LANDING Findings 1. DISTANCE/ALTITUDE - MISJUDGED - DUAL STUDENT 2. FLARE - IMPROPER - DUAL STUDENT 3. (C) REMEDIAL ACTION - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND(CFI) 4. (C) PROPER ALIGNMENT - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND(CFI) 5. TERRAIN CONDITION - GRASS

Investigation Docket: NTSB accident and incident dockets serve as permanent archival information for the NTSB’s  investigations. Dockets released prior to June 1, 2009 are publicly available from the NTSB’s  Record Management Division at pubinq@ntsb.gov, or at 800-877-6799. Dockets released after  this date are available at http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/.  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated  by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine  the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate  the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and  decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and  statistical reviews.  The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence  or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a  matter mentioned in the report. A factual report that may be admissible under 49 U.S.C. § 1154(b) is available here.
