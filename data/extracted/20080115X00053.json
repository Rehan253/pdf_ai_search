He commented that he lost visual contact with the ground immediately upon  liftoff.  During the initial climb, the airplane momentarily entered a nose-down attitude.  He  subsequently corrected the nose down attitude.  However, as the airplane began to climb again  the right wing impacted a tree.  This occurred approximately 1 mile from the airport and within  1 minute of takeoff.  After the in-flight collision, he had \"full function\" of the airplane and  elected to continue the planned 31-minute flight to the intended destination.  He added that  there were no anomalies related to flight control or engine operation during the flight.  A post  accident inspection revealed impact damage to the leading edge of the right wing, right engine  nacelle, and right propeller spinner.  In addition, the inspection revealed a 3-inch crack in the  aft wing spar at the right main landing gear wheel well. Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's momentary loss of control after takeoff, which resulted in an in-flight collision with  a tree.  A contributing factor was the presence of the tree."

            "text": "Page 5 of 5 CHI08CA048 The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated  by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine  the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate  the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and  decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and  statistical reviews.  The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence  or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a  matter mentioned in the report. A factual report that may be admissible under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(b) is available here."
